# Project Setup

Mods for Crusader Kings III are stored at `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod`. Although this is the path they are stored, this is not where you will want to initially create your modification. There is a way to do that from the launcher which generates the folder and `.mod` file for you.

## Step-by-Step Guide

* Start the game launcher and go to the `Mods` tab.
* Click on the `Mod Tools` button.
* Fill in all the fields to match your mod, including the tags.
* Click the `Create` button and a mod folder and `.mod` file will be generated.
* Go to the mod folder at `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod/<ModHere>`.
* You can start making changes to your mod. See [Folder Structure](folder-structure.md).
